# iOS-Portfolio-Lembke22
basically what I've done throughout my time at EPHS

### Adv. iOS
* x

### iOS Mobile App Development
* I created a simple Pok√©mon fighting app.

### AP Computer Science A (Java)
* Yahtzee was created to be entirely played in the Terminal, or the application itself.

### AP Computer Science Principles
* The class that started it all and began my love for computer science, programming, and software development. In this course I created very first form of what is *technically* code. In MIT App Inventor, I created Yahtzee as well, but with block coding. Looking back on it, it's made up of mostly if-elses and the coding page literally lags when I try to scroll across it. I had two variable types where one was the number on a dice and another was a count of a number, which I know is redundant in any *real* programming language. Alongside that, I had a timer that ran a function every 1000th second, haha. I really don't care that my code sucked, this was my beginning and I am still very proud of what I made.
