# iOS-Portfolio-Lembke22
Hey, my name is Evan Lembke. Here is a compilation of all of the nerd stuff that I have done, created, or participated in throughout my time at Eden Prairie High School. The world of technology has always been fascinating to me and taking these classes pretty much cemented my career field. From learning the blocky, clunky fundementals to feeling ectascy when the 23 errors are finally fixed and compiled, computer science has been a blast and a can't wait to learn more.



### Advanced iOS Mobile App Development
* I worked in a group to create a [bubble-shooting word game](https://github.com/90306561/BubbleWords). Wordle was very popular at this time, so we were enthusiastic in making an app related to that. It was the heyday of creating varients of the original, so that was where our inspiration came from. We had experience in giving an object with a velocity, so we decided to make a word version of the many match-3 bubble shooters, like [Puzzle Bobble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble). We encountered some difficulty when we decided it would be a good idea to change the name of our name without looking up how to do it. In short, a bunch of location errors made the program impossible to run and we had to start from scratch. At the moment, we have a successful app that can spell words from cannon shots.
* After weeks of work, the app looks much nicer and is even published on the Apple App Store!

### iOS Mobile App Development
* I created a [simple Pokémon fighting app](https://github.com/Lembke2448/bingo) with a partner. I was in charge of programming while they wanted to do the art. The way that this app works is that it follows a very simple Rock-Paper-Scissors format in dealing damage. It took very basic randomizition initializations to determine what was assigned and you have a better chance to "catch" the opposing Pokémon when the health. You even have a chance to get a different colored "shiny" varient when you played.

### AP Computer Science A (Java)
* I created a Yahtzee program to be played in the Terminal, or the only in the application itself, because I don't know what the correct technical term is. My intention was to have a bunch of card games and/or dice games all together in one program, but ended up with only creating Yahtzee and finding a means to describe how to work the app with just a text box.


### AP Computer Science Principles
* The class that started it all and began my love for computer science, programming, and software development. In this course I created very first form of what is *technically* code. In MIT App Inventor, I created Yahtzee as well, but with block coding. Looking back on it, it's made up of mostly if-elses and the coding page literally lags when I try to scroll across it. I had two variable types where one was the number on a dice and another was a count of a number, which I know is redundant in any *real* programming language. Alongside that, I had a timer that ran a function every 1000th second, haha. I really don't care that my code sucked, this was my beginning and I am still very proud of what I made.
